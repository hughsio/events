Each spring, Washington, D.C. transforms into a sea of pink, inviting people from around the world to take part in the National Cherry Blossom Festival—one of the District’s most iconic and unifying traditions. The festival commemorates the 1912 gift of Japanese cherry trees from Tokyo Mayor Yukio Ozaki to the people of Washington, D.C.

For the University of the District of Columbia, the festival commemorates more than just a welcome return to warm weather. It’s a shared moment of joy, celebration, partnership and hometown pride.

This year, UDC proudly celebrates 15 years as a sponsor and active partner of the National Cherry Blossom Festival, a role that has elevated the university’s visibility and affirmed its place as a vibrant and essential part of the life of the District.
